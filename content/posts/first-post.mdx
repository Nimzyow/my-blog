# Building a Blog with Cursor.AI

In this post, I'll walk you through how I built this blog using Cursor.AI, Next.js, and MDX. Let's dive in!

## What is Cursor.AI?

Cursor.AI is an AI-powered code editor that helps you write code faster and more efficiently. It's like having a pair programmer that understands your codebase and can help you write better code.

## The Setup Process

1. First, I installed Cursor.AI from [cursor.so](https://cursor.so)
2. Created a new Next.js project with:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-blog --typescript --tailwind
   ```
3. Added MDX support for writing blog posts
4. Set up the basic file structure:
   - `/content/posts/` for blog posts
   - `/src/pages/` for Next.js pages
   - `/src/components/` for React components

## Key Features

- **MDX Support**: Write blog posts in Markdown with React components
- **Tailwind CSS**: Beautiful, responsive styling
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Static Site Generation**: Fast loading times and great SEO

## Deployment

I deployed the blog using:

1. Docker for containerization
2. Ansible for local deployment
3. DigitalOcean for hosting
4. Nginx as a reverse proxy
5. Certbot for SSL certificates

## Conclusion

Using Cursor.AI significantly sped up the development process. Its code completion and AI-powered suggestions helped me write better code faster, especially when setting up the blog's infrastructure.

The best part? This entire blog post was written with the help of Cursor.AI! ðŸ˜„
